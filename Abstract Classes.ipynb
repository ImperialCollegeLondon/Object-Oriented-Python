    "A couple of notebooks ago, we saw how the ```RegularPolygon``` class wasn't really complete on its own. It contains a property to calculate the perimeter, but this relies on an attribute describing the number of sides of the shape which we expect to be defined in child classes. In this notebook we'll look at a better way to handle this situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's perfectly reasonable to have a parent class which relies on attributes that are intended to be included as part of the child class. In this case, it's common to make the parent class what is known as an abstract class. This is a class which is not intended to be instantiated, but instead is intended to be inherited from. In Python, this is done by importing the ```ABC``` class from the ```abc``` module then causing our class to inherit from it by adding ```(ABC)``` after the name of the class. The ```abc``` module is part of the Python standard library, so it doesn't need to be installed separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we can import the ```abstractmethod``` decorator from the ```abc``` module. This decorator can be applied to methods and properties to mark them as abstract. This means that they must be overridden in child classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This decorator can be applied to instance methods, class methods, static methods, and properties. If an attribute has multiple decorators, the ```@abstractmethod``` decorator must be the innermost (lowest) decorator. For example:\n"
