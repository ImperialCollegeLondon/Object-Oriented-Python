    "# Final Exam\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final exam you will define a series of classes in the code cell below to represent types of food. The code cell following it contains a series of tests that your code must pass. These tests will also help to inform what the classes should look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should define a class `Ingredient` that has the attributes:\n",
    "* `amount`: the amount of the ingredient. May represent the number of items, mass or volume depending on the ingredient. Should be supplied to the constructor. If the value is zero or less, raise a `ValueError`.\n",
    "* `calories`: Describes the number of calories in the ingredient. Will de defined in subclasses of `Ingredient`.\n",
    "* `preparation_time`: Describes the time it takes to prepare the ingredient in minutes. Will be defined in subclasses of `Ingredient`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should define a number of classes that inherit from `Ingredient`. Some of these will require additional data to be supplied in the constructor to describe how they are prepared. The subclasses are:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Class | Additional attributes | Calories | Preparation time |\n",
    "|-------|-----------------------|----------|------------------|\n",
    "| `Apple` | `chopped`: `bool` | 52 x amount | 3 x amount if `chopped` is `True`, 0 otherwise |\n",
    "| `Tomato` | `chopped`: `bool` | 22 x amount | 2 x amount if `chopped` is `True`, 0 otherwise |\n",
    "| `Pasta` | N/A | 1.31 x amount | 10 |\n",
    "| `Chicken` | `boneless`: `bool` | 2.39 x amount | 20 if `boneless` is `True`, 30 otherwise |\n",
    "| `Beef` | `boneless`: `bool` | 2.5 x amount | 30 if `boneless` is `True`, 40 otherwise |\n",
    "| `Oil` | N/A | 8.84 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also define a class `Recipe` that has the attributes:\n",
    "* `name`: a string that describes the recipe. Should be supplied to the constructor.\n",
    "* `ingredients`: a list of `Ingredient` objects that are used in the recipe. Should be supplied to the constructor. If the list is empty, raise a `ValueError`.\n",
    "* `calories`: the total number of calories in all ingredients in the recipe.\n",
    "* `preparation_time`: the total time it takes to prepare all ingredients in the recipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also define any other attributes or classes to help you complete the task so long as the tests pass. There is more than one reasonable way to complete this task so use your own judgement. "
